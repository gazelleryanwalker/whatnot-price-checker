## üí° Usage Guide

### Basic Price Check

   - Size: e.g., "10" or "10.5"
   - Condition: Select "New" or "Used"

### Understanding Results

- **Max Bid (2x ROI)**: Maximum you should bid for 100% profit
- **Expected Profit**: Projected profit at each ROI level

### Example Calculation

- Net selling price after fees: $404.80
- Max bid for 2x ROI: $202.40
- Expected profit: $202.40
- Your ROI: 100%

# Dockerfile included in project
docker build -t whatnot-price-checker .
docker run -p 5000:5000 whatnot-price-checker
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server won't start**:
- Check Python version: `python --version` (need 3.11+)
- Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Slow response times**:
- Check internet connection
- Restart the server
- Clear browser cache

**Price data not loading**:
- Verify product name spelling
- Try different size format (e.g., "10" vs "10.0")
- Check if product exists on reseller sites

### Performance Optimization

**For faster responses**:
- Use wired internet connection
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Run server locally rather than cloud during auctions

## üìä Understanding Platform Fees

### StockX
- **Seller Fee**: 9.5%
- **Shipping**: $15
- **Processing**: 2-3 business days

### GOAT
- **Seller Fee**: 9.5%
- **Shipping**: $15
- **Processing**: 1-2 business days

### KicksCrew
- **Seller Fee**: 8%
- **Shipping**: $20 (international)
- **Processing**: 3-5 business days

## üí∞ Profit Calculation Formula

```
Net Selling Price = Market Price - Platform Fee - Shipping Cost
Max Bid = Net Selling Price √∑ Target Multiplier
Expected Profit = Net Selling Price - Max Bid
ROI = (Expected Profit √∑ Max Bid) √ó 100%
```
